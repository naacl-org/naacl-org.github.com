Chair Nominee:
----------------------
<a name="Anna Rumshisky"> </a>

### [Anna Rumshisky](https://www.cs.uml.edu/~arum/)

#### Bio
Anna Rumshisky is an Associate Professor of Computer Science at the University of Massachusetts Lowell, where she leads the Text Machine Lab for NLP. Her research centers on large language models, with a focus on efficient large-model training, model analysis, and interpretability. Over the past five years, she has also held a joint role in industry as an Amazon Academic with the Amazon AGIF (Artificial General Intelligence Foundations) organization, working on foundational model development at scale. She has served as Program Chair for NAACL 2021 and as an elected member of the NAACL Executive Board (2022–2023), and has held senior area chair roles across major conferences including ACL, EMNLP, NeurIPS, ICLR, and ICML. She has organized numerous workshops and tutorials, including the Clinical NLP and Insights from Negative Results in NLP series, and founded the annual New England NLP Meeting series. Drawing on her experience bridging academic and industry research environments, she brings a broad view of how to sustain and evolve the NLP community as it grows in scale and scope.

#### Candidacy Statement
I am honored to run for Chair of the NAACL Executive Committee. Having served as NAACL 2021 Program Chair and as an elected board member (2022-2023), I have witnessed firsthand both the remarkable growth of our community and the challenges that come with scaling while preserving what makes NAACL special. My dual perspective, gained from spending half my time in academia at UMass Lowell and half in industry, has given me insight into how we can strengthen our community across different research environments.  

If elected as Chair, I would focus on the following three areas:

**Sustaining Community at Scale.** As our field experiences explosive growth with the rise of large language models, NAACL must evolve its structures while maintaining the collaborative spirit that has defined our community. I will work to ensure that increased submission volumes do not come at the cost of review quality or meaningful participation. This includes exploring innovative approaches to peer review within the ARR system, drawing on successful practices from large ML conferences such as NeurIPS and ICLR. Examples include AI-assisted review quality tracking to support area chairs, calibration periods for AC and reviewer discussions to improve consistency, and Best Reviewer awards and registration perks for top reviewers and area chairs to sustain engagement and reward high-quality work.

**Strengthening Academia-Industry Partnerships.** The boundary between academic and industry NLP research has become increasingly fluid. As model scaling (and the science of model scaling) becomes more and more dominant as the way to improve abilities of AI models, frontier research is shifting to industry labs that can afford the experiments needed to make advances in training models at scale. At the same time, the cost of experiments at scale is influencing how research priorities are set in frontier labs. This setup discourages the exploration of unproven directions since it's very costly. Consequently, much industry research follows a very narrow trajectory, potentially risking convergence to a local optimum. The role of academic research has always been exactly this kind of exploration. But at the same time, a lot of academic work becomes "proof of concept" until scaled. Understanding this interplay and ensuring that it is understood and encouraged by both sides is crucial. Having worked in both environments for the past five years, I've seen how crucial and how challenging it is to maintain productive collaboration between these communities. I will advocate for initiatives that facilitate knowledge transfer and collaboration and work to develop programs that help academic researchers navigate industry partnerships while maintaining open science principles.

**Expanding Regional Engagement Across the Americas.** NAACL's evolution to represent the Nations of the Americas is more than a name change - it's a commitment to genuinely serve researchers across both continents. My experience founding the New England NLP Meeting series has shown me the value of regional community building. I will work to support and expand similar initiatives throughout the Americas, ensuring that researchers in underserved regions have pathways to participate fully in NAACL. This includes advocating for conference locations beyond major US cities and expanding mentorship and financial support programs for researchers from underrepresented institutions.

#### Candidacy Statement
**Broadening NAACL's Reach and Inclusivity**
The renaming of our chapter to "Nations of the Americas" signifies a profound commitment that demands tangible action. It is imperative that we actively champion research and researchers from across the Global Majority. I will advocate for an increase in dedicated research tracks, workshops, and resources for underrepresented languages and cultures, ensuring that our conferences extend beyond a sole focus on high-resource language technologies. Furthermore, a crucial aspect of this mission involves proactively identifying conference venues and implementing policy structures that reduce barriers to participation. This includes working towards tiered registration fees, increasing need based fee waivers, and formalizing robust support systems to accommodate diverse needs. It also touches upon enhancing the hybrid experience in order to make it more engaging and inclusive of those who are not able to attend in person.

**Enhancing the Review Process**
As the volume of submissions continues to rise, it is critical that we implement structural changes to uphold the rigor and developmental value of our review process. I will explore and advocate for mechanisms that directly link the quality of reviewing service at all levels to current and future submission privileges. This approach will cultivate a greater sense of community accountability and help mitigate the submission of low-effort or late reviews and meta reviews. Furthermore, I will work towards dedicating workshop space at the conference for reviewer training, facilitating the integration of newer researchers into the process and educating them on best practices.


<a name="Francisco (Paco) Guzmán"> </a>

### [Francisco (Paco) Guzmán](https://guzmanhe.github.io/)

#### Bio
I'm Francisco (Paco) Guzmán, Head of AI Research at Handshake. I lead research on data quality and evaluation; creating data and systems that expand the knowledge and reliability of frontier AI through expert data. Previously at Meta, I led efforts like NLLB-200 (expanding translation to 200 languages and billions of speakers) and SeamlessM4T (recognized by TIME as one of 2023's best inventions), pushing multilingual and open-science work that expanded language technology access worldwide. I also led post-training teams for Llama 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3; advancing open-weights models that empower researchers globally.

I created the AI Learning Alliance (AILA) with Georgia Tech, partnering with HBCUs, HSIs to democratize AI education; co-created the TICO-19 initiative to make COVID-19 information accessible in 35+ languages; organized the first WMT shared task on African languages; and have served as Co-Research Director at AMTA (2020-2022), Ethics Co-Chair at EMNLP 2023, and Area Chair at conferences including NeurIPS, ACL, and EMNLP.  I'm deeply committed to mentorship and to building research ecosystems in industry and academia that scale inclusion and provide opportunities for everyone.

#### Candidacy Statement
NAACL is where rigor, openness, and inclusivity converge. I'm running for the Board to strengthen those pillars by investing in three areas:

**Compute access fund:** Access to compute has become the major inequalizer in research. Smaller universities across the Americas, particularly in Latin America, cannot compete when frontier research requires resources only industry can afford. I will establish a NAACL Compute Fund in partnership with cloud providers (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Azure), making grants available to researchers at institutions without significant compute budgets. This fund will lower the entrance bar so more researchers in the Americas can conduct cutting-edge research and remain competitive in the AI era. Success will be measured by: number of institutions served, papers published using the grants, and geographic distribution across the hemisphere.

**Evaluation standards and reproducibility:** With training data contamination threatening benchmark validity, establish lightweight, NAACL-endorsed rubrics for dataset quality, reproducibility, and contamination checks. This raises the floor for fairness and transparency in our review and benchmark culture, protecting research integrity while making good science easier to verify.

**Mentorship and regional collaboration:** Scale mentorship programs connecting students with experienced researchers from academia and industry. Establish a NAACL Research Apprenticeship Program that provides grants for paid internships at leading labs across the Americas; targeting not only NLP students but also researchers from other disciplines (Biology, Physics, Chemistry, Social Sciences) to foster interdisciplinary AI research addressing real-world problems across language barriers. Support regional workshops and shared tasks that strengthen our continental identity; ensuring researchers have platforms to showcase work on problems unique to the Americas.

NAACL's strength lies in its people and its standards. My goal is to help the organization set both higher and fairer; so good science is easier to do and verify across the Americas. I commit to substantial time for board work and championing transparency in our publication guidelines.

He has organized numerous international workshops (ICLR, AAAI, IJCAI, WWW, AKBC, AAAI Spring Symposium) on emerging topics such as agentic AI for scientific discovery, and served as a Program Chair for SouthNLP 2024, the first regional NLP initiative in the southern United States.

#### Candidacy Statement
Our field continues to grow at an unprecedented pace, fueled by large foundation models and their transformative applications across science and society. This rapid evolution brings both opportunities and challenges. If elected, I will work to ensure that NAACL remains an intellectual leader, supporting rigorous science, inclusive participation, and impactful collaboration.

**Reimagining the Review Ecosystem:** The rapid growth in submissions has placed unprecedented pressure on our review system, raising concerns about fairness, quality, and reviewer workload. Addressing these challenges requires both structural changes and innovations such as human–AI collaboration. I will advocate for initiatives such as adopting a two-stage review process, as in AAAI, to ensure reviewers focus their efforts on papers with real potential; setting up clearer guidelines for review discussions to avoid unnecessary ad hoc experimental requests; leveraging AI assistants for triaging low-quality papers, monitoring reviewer performance, synthesizing discussions for area chairs, etc., to make the process more efficient, fair, and sustainable for our growing community.

**Building Sustainable Academia–Industry Synergy:** The divide between academia and industry is widening, with industry advancing massive-scale pretraining while academia pursues fundamental innovations under resource constraints. NAACL can serve as a vital convening ground for sustainable collaboration by introducing industry–academia tracks, establishing resource-sharing partnerships, and expanding communication channels to promote transparency on practical challenges, emerging research directions, and ethical considerations, to ensure both communities can benefit from and contribute to the field’s progress.

**Fostering Open, Interdisciplinary, and Reproducible Research:** With much of today’s work centered on large langauge models (LLMs) and their applications, NAACL must adapt to this shift while ensuring the field’s long-term vitality. As LLMs increasingly permeate domains such as healthcare, social science, materials science, education, etc., it is essential to create new channels, such as interdisciplinary tracks and workshops, that invite researchers from diverse fields to contribute and foster genuine cross-disciplinary collaboration. Equally important is a stronger commitment to openness—releasing models, datasets, benchmarks, weights, and full experimental details to drive transparency, reproducibility, and long-term progress.

**Broadening Access Across the Research Community:** Expanding participation and visibility for researchers from under-resourced regions and institutions is essential, particularly for those unable to attend conferences due to high travel costs or visa restrictions. Overcoming these barriers requires deliberate action when selecting conference locations, structuring travel grant programs, and shaping participation policies, ensuring that all researchers can contribute meaningfully and engage fully in our community regardless of location or circumstance.

#### Candidacy Statement
As a board member, I would like to work on the following challenges (and opportunities) within our community:

**Open research and reproducibility:** I strongly believe in the importance of open research—specifically, the release of code and data, as well as the transparent discussion of limitations, ethical considerations, and potential flaws in our work. In an era where proprietary models often dominate the landscape, our community must prioritize accessibility and collaboration. I'm excited to work together to foster an environment where transparency and collaboration thrive!

**Diversity and inclusion:** As the NLP community is growing rapidly in recent years, ensuring diversity and inclusion is more crucial than ever. It’s not just about representing different demographics; it’s equally important to engage participants at various stages of their careers, particularly early-career researchers. Building on the great work of past board members, I envision initiatives that actively support underrepresented communities in our conferences. This could include backing workshops like WiNLP, which elevate diverse voices in NLP, and supporting mentoring programs, which promote our field to younger generations, such as junior graduate students and even undergraduate students, to entice researchers from varied backgrounds. By fostering a welcoming and collaborative environment, we can ensure that everyone has a seat at the table.

**Interdisciplinary research:** The applications of large language models (LLMs) are expanding quickly, as we deploy more NLP systems, it’s crucial to address their social impacts, safety, and ethical implications. Tackling these challenges calls for a strong emphasis on interdisciplinary research. I am committed to promoting collaboration across various fields—be it psychology, law, healthcare, or business—because I believe that insights from these areas can drive innovative advancements in NLP. As a board member, I will advocate for initiatives that create dedicated tracks or workshops which encourage interdisciplinary efforts and ensure NLP technologies contribute positively and responsibly to society.

#### Candidacy Statement
If elected to the NAACL Board, I will focus on strengthening the integrity, fairness, and accountability of our NLP research ecosystem through the following priorities:

**Integrity of Language Model Evaluation:** The NLP community faces an urgent challenge in maintaining evaluation integrity, especially as data leakage becomes increasingly difficult to avoid. Too often, models are evaluated on data overlapping with their training sources—an issue frequently underreported in publications. I will advocate for requiring a dedicated **“Evaluation Integrity”** section within ethics statements to ensure greater transparency, disclosure, and reproducibility in language model research.

**Fair Treatment of Resubmitted Papers:** Authors who revise and resubmit to ARR frequently face inconsistent reviewing because prior reviewers are often unavailable, resulting in papers being treated as entirely new submissions. Having personally experienced this frustration, I will work with ARR Editors, in my role as Communications Chair, to introduce **distinct review forms** for new and resubmitted papers—-promoting continuity, fairness, and proper contextualization of prior feedback.

**Reviewer Accountability in ARR:** High-quality reviewing is essential to our field’s credibility. I will advocate for improved **reviewer accountability** through structured feedback mechanisms, recognition for exemplary reviewers, and clear policies to address unresponsive or superficial reviews.

Together, these initiatives aim to make our review and evaluation processes more transparent, fair, and trustworthy - strengthening the foundation of NAACL’s research community.

#### Candidacy Statement
I'm honored to be considered for the NAACL Board and would be excited to contribute to the community in three key areas: improving the review process in the LLM era, fostering interdisciplinary research, e.g., Agentic AI + X, and supporting open, reproducible science.

**Encouraging Interdisciplinary Collaboration**
We have a real opportunity to strengthen NAACL as a space where interdisciplinary research is welcomed and well-supported. I would advocate for clear pathways for these submissions, through special tracks, diverse review expertise, and community workshops, so we can better reflect the broad impact of language technologies.

**Improving the Peer Review Process**
The peer review process faces new challenges in the era of LLMs. I believe we can adapt constructively. I would support efforts such as making review comments public for all accepted papers, light auditing of review quality, and recognition for thoughtful reviewing. These steps would help preserve the integrity of peer review while acknowledging current practices.

**Promoting Open and Reproducible Research**
I care deeply about research that is transparent and accessible. I'd like to explore stronger support for reproducibility, such as incentives for sharing code and data, and space for replication studies, especially those focused on underrepresented languages and domains. These practices are essential for scientific progress and inclusivity.

I look forward to contributing to a NAACL that continues to grow as an open, thoughtful community!


<a name="Ana Marasović"> </a>

### [Ana Marasović](https://www.anamarasovic.com)

#### Bio
Ana Marasović is an Assistant Professor in the Kahlert School of Computing at the University of Utah. Her research interests broadly fall into NLP, human-centered AI, and interpretability. Previously, she was a Young Investigator at the Allen Institute for AI with a courtesy appointment at the University of Washington, and completed her PhD at Heidelberg University. She is a co-recipient of the Best Paper Award at ACL 2023, the Best Paper Honorable Mention at ACL 2020, and the Best Paper Award at SoCal 2022 NLP Symposium. Her work was selected as a CoLM 2025 Spotlight. She is also the University of Utah One-U Responsible AI Initiative Faculty Fellow and UC Berkeley EECS 2020 Rising Star. 

#### Candidacy Statement
If elected to the NAACL board, I would work to:

**Simplify research submission and presentation processes:**
- I’d like to revisit the ARR mandatory checklist. While well-intentioned, its usefulness for authors and reviewers is assumed, it adds work for those who already follow good scientific practices (e.g., properly cite datasets/models), and is lengthy and written in a way that requires following the long guidelines. I’d start with surveying the community on its usefulness relative to the overhead it creates.
- I’d work with the community to find better ways to support those who can’t attend conferences, while having a smooth presentation process for the majority who do. Currently, presenters are required to upload both a poster and a talk a month in advance, even though they will present only one of these at the conference. These materials are then gatekept in Underline rather than being publicly accessible. 

**Re-engage the broader LLM research community with NAACL:**
- Another priority for me is that NAACL, and ACL/EMNLP, attract researchers publishing impactful and creative LLM and adjacent research who haven’t typically seen these conferences as their home. Many of the ideas that influenced LLMs and their use, such as BPE tokenization, BERT, dense passage retrieval, transformers library, among others, were presented at our conferences. Similarly, our community also produces work central to sub-areas like mechanistic interpretability. However, as discussed in the EMNLP 2024 panel on “The Importance of NLP in the LLM Era,” members of the broader AI community are hesitant to submit to our venues, and some who previously did have stopped. I’d like to understand these concerns and discuss ways to make our conferences more welcoming and relevant for these researchers.

**Improve the reviewing process:**
- Needless to say, issues with review quality and community burnout carry on. I’d support efforts to make progress on these by focusing on the reviewer pool and recognition. I believe we should identify junior researchers capable and invested in reviewing, even if they do not yet meet current qualifications. Further, while current efforts focus on penalizing poor reviews, we should complement these with initiatives that recognize excellent ones. Outstanding reviewers should be better acknowledged, celebrated publicly, and well-rewarded. For example, with a registration for an in-person conference and a badge on their anthology profile. I would even suggest that the next submissions of outstanding reviewers are assigned to other outstanding reviewers.

#### Candidacy Statement
I am honored by the nomination to serve on the NAACL board. NAACL has always felt to me like a place where research ideas meet practice, and where our community grows stronger through that exchange. I would be grateful for the chance to give back and help guide its future.
If elected, I would focus on these priorities:

**Bridging academia and industry.** Many recent advances in NLP have come from industry labs, while academia continues to shape the fundamental questions and directions of our field. Having worked in both settings, I’ve seen how valuable it is when these communities engage with each other. I want to help NAACL be a space where those conversations happen more naturally—whether through joint workshops, shared resources, or open challenges.

**Language AI for social good.** Beyond technical progress, I believe our community has a responsibility to consider how NLP can improve lives. I am particularly interested in how language technologies can support people with social disabilities, such as autism, by helping with communication and interaction. More broadly, I want NAACL to encourage research that addresses accessibility, equity, and other societal needs where language AI can make a meaningful difference.

**User-centric evaluation and real-world feedback loops.** Too often, our systems are evaluated only on static benchmarks, while real-world use reveals very different strengths and weaknesses. I would like NAACL to encourage research that includes human evaluation, iterative feedback, and deployment studies, so that our models are measured not just by accuracy, but by how well they actually serve people. Building these feedback loops into our research will make our work more robust, trustworthy, and impactful outside the lab.

It is an honor to be nominated for the NAACL Board. If elected, my goal is to strengthen NAACL as a community that is simultaneously rigorous, inclusive, and forward-looking. I will focus on the following priorities:

**Supporting diverse research directions in the LLM era.** While large language models dominate today’s NLP landscape, I believe NAACL must continue to nurture high-risk, high-reward ideas, spanning new architectures, efficient training, human-centered evaluation, and theory-driven approaches. I will advocate for review practices and conference programming that encourage intellectual diversity.

**Expanding inclusivity across the Americas.** Building on NAACL’s transition to the “Nations of the Americas Chapter,” I will work to lower barriers for underrepresented researchers, including travel and registration support, regional workshops, and mentorship programs that connect students and junior scholars across North, Central, and South America.

**Strengthening bridges between academia, industry, and education.** Having worked closely with both academic and industrial communities, I see great opportunity for NAACL to facilitate deeper exchange, through industrial tracks, interdisciplinary panels, and collaborations that connect cutting-edge research with real-world impact. I am also committed to promoting outreach to high school and undergraduate students, inspiring the next generation of computational linguists.

**Enhancing transparency and sustainability in community practices.** From conference organization to peer review, our processes must be clear, fair, and scalable as the community grows. I will support innovations such as reciprocal review, reviewer mentorship, and hybrid/virtual participation models that broaden access while reducing burdens.

NAACL has long been a home for rigorous science and a vibrant community. I would be honored to serve on the board and help shape its next chapter.

#### Candidacy Statement
I’m running for a board position to strengthen NAACL’s research integrity, community wellbeing, and operational sustainability—--three areas that underpin long-term excellence but are often underserved.

**Research integrity and responsible data/AI practices.** I will champion clear, field-specific guidance for the responsible use of generative tools in authoring and reviewing; robust conflict-of-interest and authorship transparency; and community-vetted data governance (consent, provenance, licensing) with practical checklists. I’ll work to expand artifact badging beyond code/data release to include data documentation, safety evaluations, and compute reporting, helping our results remain trustworthy and reproducible at scale.

**Accessibility, safety, and equitable participation.** I will propose a standard NAACL “access package” for every event:
- disability-first accessibility requirements, 
- robust hybrid accessibility (ASR captioning, Q&A parity), 
- on-site childcare support (often times available but lack proper resources and attention), 
- visa assistance timelines (a very time consuming and deterring issue that is haunting international students nowadays). Being an immigrant and a long time visa applicant for ACL conferences, I believe I can help streamline the documentation and assistance guidance by providing online office hours and forming a community to help NAACL attendees.
- Finally, escalation paths, and a strengthened, independent code-of-conduct response team with post-event transparency reports. 
These measures make participation safer and more predictable for everyone.

**Sustainable, scalable operations.** I will push for a re-usable “conference playbook” and shared tooling (templates, budgets, sponsor ethics policy, COI automation) to reduce organizer burnout. I will also advocate for greener events (supplier standards, experimentation with green options, low-waste policies, and carbon reporting with opt-in offsets) and for recognizing service with formal citation/credit so invisible labor is visible in hiring and promotion.

By investing in integrity, accessibility, and sustainable operations, NAACL can safeguard scientific trust, broaden who can participate, and make it easier for volunteers to deliver outstanding conferences year after year. I’d be honored to help implement these concrete, durable improvements.

As an active member of the NLP community for many years, I am deeply committed to the continued success of our vibrant field and am eager for the opportunity to serve our community in this new capacity.

**My Commitment to the Community:** My dedication to our community is rooted in service. I have been a consistent Program Committee Member and Area Chair for our top conferences, including NAACL, ACL, and EMNLP, as well as for NeurIPS and ICML. This experience has given me a profound appreciation for the hard work that underpins our scientific progress and for the critical importance of maintaining a fair, rigorous, and supportive academic publishing process.

**My Vision for NAACL:** A Responsible, Resilient, and Inclusive Future: We are at a pivotal moment. The impact of our work has never been greater, and with this influence comes profound responsibility. My vision for NAACL is to empower our community to not only lead the world in technical innovation but also to set the standard for developing trustworthy, secure, and ethical AI. If elected, I will dedicate my energy to three key pillars:

- _Championing Trustworthy and Resilient NLP:_ Our greatest challenge is shifting from "capability" to "reliability." I will work to establish NAACL as a leading venue for research in AI safety and security. I propose creating new forums, such as dedicated special tracks or workshop series, to advance research in adversarial robustness, data privacy, and model transparency. Drawing on my work on the TrustLLM benchmark and vulnerability analysis, we can foster a proactive culture of identifying and mitigating risks, ensuring that LLM innovations are built on a foundation of trust.

- _Empowering the Next Generation for a New AI Era:_ The rapid pace of technology can be unsettling, especially for junior researchers. I will be a strong advocate for initiatives that support our students and early-career members. Leveraging my dual experience in both academia and industrial research labs, I will work to expand mentorship programs that offer clear guidance on navigating research and diverse career paths in the age of LLMs. We must ensure the next generation of NLP researchers is equipped not only with cutting-edge technical skills but also with a strong ethical compass.

- _Fostering a Collaborative and Interdisciplinary Ecosystem:_ The most impactful solutions will come from collaboration. I am committed to strengthening the ties between academia, industry, and policy stakeholders. I will champion programs that lower the barrier to interdisciplinary research, particularly where NLP is applied in high-stakes domains like medicine and security. By creating more opportunities for meaningful exchange, we can accelerate the translation of foundational research into real-world applications that are both innovative and socially responsible.

I am excited by the prospect of working with the board and all of you to build an innovative, inclusive, and responsible future for NAACL. Thank you for your consideration.

#### Candidacy Statement
I believe we are living in a remarkable era for NAACL (and broader NLP community): research advances in NLP/AI, combined with national priorities around AI innovation, are bringing unprecedented scientific progress. At the same time, we face critical challenges: (i) **Bridging Academia and Industry:** Many academic research directions struggle to attract industry attention or deliver real-world impact, which can dissuade top Ph.D. students from pursuing academic careers. (ii) **Over-Concentration of Focus:** The community risks narrowing too much around LLM-related topics, potentially overlooking long-term, diverse research directions.  (iii) **Barriers to Participation:** International researchers, under-resourced colleges, and even high-school students often face financial and logistical obstacles that prevent them from engaging with NAACL events. (iv) **Research Integrity and Quality:** Widespread use of generative AI, less controlled reviewer qualifications, and limited mechanisms to ensure post-review improvements are creating new challenges for maintaining academic rigor and trustworthiness. 

If elected to the NAACL Board, I aim to address these issues through the following initiatives: (i) **Strengthening Industry–Academia Collaboration:** I will work to organize a higher volume of industry-led talks, panels, and product-focused sessions to bring fresh ideas and practical challenges back into the academic conversation. (ii) **Setting Ambitious Research Directions:** I will advocate for yearly dynamic, “moonshot” themes that encourage the community to explore visionary, underexplored problems. (iii) **Broadening Access to NLP Research:** I plan to expand outreach efforts to engage colleges and even high-school students, aligning with the U.S. national priority of growing AI talent pipelines. (iv) **Safeguarding Research Integrity:** We will collaborate with platforms like OpenReview to experiment with mechanisms such as reviewer training, structured revision validation, and (where necessary) sanctions for repeated integrity violations. 

My research program (AI4ResearchIntegrity) and my rich service experience have well prepared me to contribute meaningfully to NAACL’s future. I am eager to help shape a community that remains vibrant, inclusive, and globally influential.
