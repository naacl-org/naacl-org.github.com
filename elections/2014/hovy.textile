h4. Bio

Eduard Hovy recently joined the Language Technologies Institute at CMU, after heading the Natural Language Group at USC/ISI for many years.  He has performed research in topics like coreference, summarization, text mining, information extraction, QA, machine translation evaluation, and language generation.  He served as the President of ACL in 2001.  

h4. Candidacy Statement

I have two goals.  First, NAACL is ten years old this year.  It has developed rather differently than was originally intended, and does not fulfill its potential as a bridge between other more-mature areas of language technology (including IR and Speech Recognition).  It was suggested that I (as one of the establishers of the society) may help in exploring a wider role for the NAACL and the conference.  Second, as described in www.force11.org, the potential of new forms of publication (pdf+code+corpus, interrelated with other publications, with tools to analyze and process them in interesting ways) is a vision that can deeply change all of scholarly publication, in sciences and humanities alike.  Our community is the one to make [much of] this possible.  I would like to make this happen.
