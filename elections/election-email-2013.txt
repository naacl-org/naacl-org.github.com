nominee and giving evidence that he or she will serve if elected.
(It is recommended that this evidence consist of a forwarded email
from the nominee containing a candidate statement, a biographical
sketch, homepage URL, and a brief affirmation of intent to serve
if elected.) In addition, the nominees for Chair should meet the
criteria set out in the NAACL constitution.

Election process:

The voting period will begin once the final slate of candidates and

is scheduled to close on December 20th.

Many thanks to the Nominating Committee -- Hal Daume (Chair), Ted
Pedersen, Suzanne Stevenson, Chris Brew, Kristina Toutanova, Owen
Rambow -- for doing the hard work of putting together an excellent
slate of nominees.
