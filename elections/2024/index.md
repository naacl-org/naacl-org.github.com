Chair Nominee:
----------------------
<a name="Graham Neubig"> </a>

### [Graham Neubig](https://www.phontron.com/)

#### Bio

Graham Neubig is an associate professor at the Language Technologies Institute of Carnegie Mellon University. His research focuses on natural language processing, with a particular interest in fundamentals, applications, and understanding of large language models for tasks such as question answering, code generation, and multilingual applications. His final goal is that every person in the world should be able to communicate with each-other, and with computers in their own language. He also contributes to making NLP research more accessible through open publishing of research papers, advanced NLP course materials and video lectures, and open-source software. He has previously been the Chief Technical Officer of ARR, and served on the NAACL board for 4 years. He was one of the initiators of several workshops, including the Workshop on Neural Machine Translation.

#### Candidacy Statement

My major goals as NAACL chair are two-fold:

1. I would like to maintain the high quality of our flagship conference's technical content. This includes a rigorous, fair, and constructive review process, an excellent set of talks, panels, and workshops, and forums where people can meet and discuss the most pressing issues in computational linguistics and natural language processing.
2. I would like to make NAACL as inclusive as possible from a number of perspectives. I would like to make sure that it is an organization that is easy to participate in for people all across North, Central, and South America. I would like it to make it an organization that is accessible to and useful for members of both academia and industry. And I would like to make it an organization where linguists can talk to machine learners and vice-versa, so we can all learn from each-other.

I believe my past experience as the initiator of several workshops, member of the NAACL board, role in handling the logistics of ARR, and participant in several grassroots NLP initiatives run by language communities (such as Masakhane and AmericasNLP), have left me well prepared to take on these tasks.


Secretary Nominees:
----------------------
<a name="Jessy Li"> </a>

### [Jessy Li](https://jessyli.com/)

#### Bio

Jessy Li is an associate professor in the Department of Linguistics at the University of Texas at Austin. She received her PhD in 2017 from the Department of Computer and Information Science at the University of Pennsylvania.

She has received the NSF CAREER award for her work on discourse and text simplification. Jessy has been a (Senior) Area Chair for many *ACL and AAAI conferences, a (Senior) Action Editor for ACL Rolling Review, and an Associate Editor for the Dialogue & Discourse journal. She was honored as an Outstanding Area Chair (EMNLP 2020) and an Outstanding Senior Program Committee Member (AAAI 2020). She was a Program Co-Chair for SIGDIAL 2022, and has served on the SIGDIAL board from 2019--2021 and from 2023–2025. She has also been a co-organizer for the Workshop on Computational Approaches to Discourse (CODI) since its inauguration in 2020, and co-organized the First Workshop on Natural Language Processing for Programming co-located with ACL 2021.

#### Candidacy Statement

It is the NAACL secretary’s responsibility to communicate within the NAACL executive committee and to the community broadly, e.g., to organize meetings, ballots, and to maintain and update media outlets. As we brace for the changing era we are in now, we have also witnessed an uptick of the frequency of major policy changes at ACL over recent years. Thus it is critical to have more timely and transparent communication than ever before. I will commit to:
Establish a regular channel and feedback loop within the community for conference-related decisions, the evolving nature of review guidelines, and new themes. This will involve regular, open surveys which we will then automatically summarize and cluster into themes, discuss during meetings, and release back to the community (with potential next-steps).
Build a stronger social media presence. As the landscape of social media shifts, we need to (i) maintain a presence on multiple social media platforms to reach different groups; (ii) regularly communicate meeting minutes to the community via these channels; (iii) aggressively promote NAACL activities and communicate policies. Additionally, I plan to establish a social media protocol that lasts beyond my term, including full documentation and volunteer training.

As part of the NAACL board, I will additionally work on the following:
Refine our submission policies according to community feedback; these include ARR adoption, ARR decision policies, the anonymity period policies, etc.
Reviewer mentoring: How we train the younger generation of reviewers means everything to the future of our field. I will work towards improving our review mentoring process even more, e.g., recognition for both mentors and mentees, a more open way to sign up to be mentored, and a balanced review workload for mentors.

Webpage: http://saifmohammad.com


#### Candidacy Statement

As scientists, we want our work to be valued. As people, we want to be part of a community. If elected secretary, I will push hard for initiatives that move the needle in these directions.

We have to make reviewing a positive and enriching experience for all involved: for example, incorporating the recent EMNLP direct discussion between reviewers and authors which really helped a lot of authors feel heard. We need to reframe our conferences to be welcoming to all scholarly investigations at the intersection of language and computation. They have traditionally over-valued new computational methods, at the expense of work that produces and investigates datasets, work that proposes new evaluations, work that explores ethics and practical applicability, work that explores problems of the global south, etc. I believe that this should change. 

NAACL has had great initiatives such as the Emerging Regions Fund for some time now, but we need to redouble our efforts to nurture vibrant local NLP communities, working on various indigenous and local languages, and on problems that matter to them – aiding in the eventual creation of Central and South American chapters.

I also believe we need to rethink our conference formats. Despite recent initiatives like BoF and Affinity groups, they are far too focused on the author/presenter, and not so much on the attendee. We have relied too much on a great location to draw attendees to conferences. However, with virtual attendance being so beneficial for those who cannot travel, we need to center the attendees (in-person and virtual) and think hard about how our conference formats can be fun, interactive, and foster a sense of belonging and community for all.


Board Member Nominees:
----------------------

<a name="Greg Durrett"> </a>

### [Greg Durrett](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~gdurrett/)

#### Bio

Greg Durrett is an associate professor of Computer Science at the University of Texas at Austin.  He obtained his PhD in 2016 from the University of California, Berkeley, where he was advised by Dan Klein. Recently, his work has been recognized by a 2023 Sloan Research Fellowship and a 2022 NSF CAREER award. Greg and his collaborators have been publishing in the ACL community actively since 2011 in areas including textual reasoning, summarization, factuality of generation, question answering, and program synthesis (along with syntactic parsing and coreference resolution during his PhD). He served as Publication Chair for EMNLP 2021 and Faculty Advisor to the NAACL Student Research Workshop in 2019.  Beyond that, he has organized 4 workshops for *CL conferences: Deep Learning for Low-resource NLP at EMNLP 2019, NLP for Programming at ACL 2021, and the Workshop on Natural Language Reasoning and Structured Explanations at ACL 2023 and ACL 2024. He has been a senior area chair for summarization and an area chair or reviewer in areas spanning interpretability, semantics, syntax, information extraction, and more.


#### Candidacy Statement

NAACL has undergone a period of rapid change and growth. The boom period of the early deep learning area, with exponentially-growing paper submissions and conference attendance, has tapered off. We now face the challenges of a new and distinct boom period, that of large language models. While NAACL and the rest of *CL are poised to be leaders in this new era, careful management will be needed to ensure this is successful.

One of the principal new challenges is that the NLP community is losing its status as intellectual leader behind recent advances. For instance, OpenAI's developments are largely external to the community, and core NLP areas like interpretability are being rebranded and coopted by others. By streamlining the current publication process, NAACL can attract a wider range of submissions and disseminate research to an even wider audience than it currently does.

I propose to support the following initiatives within NAACL, with the eventual aim of propagating such changes to the *CL conferences at large:

- Remove the arXiv anonymity period. The results of the recent survey by ACL support a case for taking action here. I agree with the arguments put forth by Michael Saxon ( https://saxon.me/blog/the-acl-anonymity-embargo-period-is-exclusionary-actually-an-early-career-researchers-perspective.html ). The anonymity period was adopted as a compromise solution that no longer makes the right tradeoffs given changes in the publishing landscape. While I am strongly in favor of a fair review process and preserving double-blind review as an institution, the negative impacts of the specific anonymity policy, particularly on early-career researchers who would benefit from discussing their work, outweigh its benefit.

- Continue to use OpenReview, but rethink ARR. The paper submission process should be simplified and receiving reviews should be tied to an accept or reject decision. We can follow a model of conferences like ICWSM and USENIX Security, which have multiple intakes for a single conference, giving multiple deadlines throughout the year while streamlining the experience for authors.

- Continue to expand diversity initiatives. Widening NLP, DEI chairs for conferences, the Student Research Workshop, and more have had major positive impacts on our community. To improve access to our conference further, I strongly support the creation of an "ACLv" (fully virtual) conference, proposed by Barbara Plank and others, to expand access.

- Continue the trend of NAACL’s increased engagement with Latin America. I strongly support continuing to host conferences in underserved regions. I am eager to hear input and discuss how to properly nurture such initiatives and grow the *CL presence there further.


<a name="Hanna Hajishirzi"> </a>

### [Hanna Hajishirzi](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~hannaneh/)

#### Bio

Hanna Hajishirzi is a Torode Family Associate Professor at the University of Washington and a Senior Director of NLP at AI2. Her research spans different areas in NLP and AI, more recently on the science of language models and language models for science. Honors include an NSF CAREER, Sloan Fellowship, Allen Distinguished Investigator Award, Intel rising star award, UIUC alumni award. She has received a best paper and several honorable mention paper awards and has served as an area chair and senior area chair at NLP and Machine Learning conferences, including NAACL, EMNLP, ACL, AAAI, and NeurIPS. 


#### Candidacy Statement

As a board member, I am excited to work on these issues within the NLP community: 

Modernize the reviewing and archiving process. The imposition of anonymity deadlines by NLP conferences has resulted in authors refraining from submitting some of their most influential papers to these forums. Conversely, a majority of machine learning and AI conferences permit the archiving of papers and facilitate open discussions subsequent to paper submissions. I hope to contribute to the modernization of the review process by advocating for the elimination of anonymity deadlines, thereby ensuring that NAACL remains the focal point of NLP-related research, including rapidly advancing research areas. 

Promote open research. With all advances in language modeling, the NLP and scientific community needs access to open models, open data, and open evaluation settings to understand and advance the science of language models. I hope to advocate for open, well-document, and reproducible research papers from the community. Consequently, this bridges the academic and industry research gap.  

Advocate for interdisciplinary research. Recently, language models have demonstrated notable efficacy in practical applications.  However, there exists potential for substantial enhancement through interdisciplinary research, thereby extending the scientific foundations of language models into diverse domains such as medicine and to scientific discovery.  I hope to promote and facilitate interdisciplinary research efforts that integrate various facets of AI and NLP into tangible real-world applications. 

AI literacy for public, k-12 students, and undergraduates: It is an exciting time for the NLP field. I am enthusiastic about disseminating knowledge to both the general public and younger generations, elucidating the capabilities and limitations inherent to language models and the broader NLP field.

#### Candidacy Statement

The past few years have been interesting for language processing in general, with a lot of advancements in the field. If elected, the areas I'd like to focus on include:
Diversity and Inclusion: Following the steps of many of the previous board members, I would be an advocate for improving diversity and inclusion in the field, through supporting the WiNLP workshop, looking for ways of supporting underrepresented communities to participate in our conferences, and promoting our field to younger generations (undergraduate and high school students) to attract researchers with diverse backgrounds.
NLP education: Given the speed of innovation in NLP, it can be challenging to create the best curriculum for undergraduate and graduate students. I'd like to organize discussions at our events and promote sharing of teaching materials with the goal of helping each other to deliver the best education possible.
Promoting open research and reproducibility: I believe it is extremely important in the era of proprietary Large Language Models and other Generative AI models to promote open research with shared tasks/datasets. NAACL has been a key driver for advocating for making the code and data shared for the accepted papers, and I will try to take this one step ahead for improved reproducibility by supporting NAACL endorsed benchmarks and challenges.

#### Candidacy Statement

We live in the most exciting times for NLP, where groundbreaking developments are occurring at a fast pace leading to transformative change in how we interact with and process natural language. If I am elected as NAACL Board Member, in addition to ensuring that we produce reproducible research, support interdisciplinary work and linguistic diversity, I would also want to focus on:
Ensuring High Quality Reviews: the NLP community has been exponentially growing over the years both in terms of the number of members as well as research papers. Despite the amazing progress we have made as a community, having high quality reviewers and reviews remains a daunting challenge for all *CL conferences. I would like to work hand in hand with NAACL’s chairs to ensure high quality reviews and implement novel mechanisms with review and reviewer scoring.
Creating NLP Expert-Industry Marketplace: each year, the NLP community unveils stellar research and groundbreaking innovations, we nurture brilliant minds and develop algorithms that continue to propel the field forward. Yet, one of the most common topics that I encountered over the years is the challenge faced by NLP experts (including graduate students, PhDs, young and mid career scientists), in securing NLP job opportunities and internships in industry. At the same time, while wearing my industry hat, I often hear colleagues complaining about the lack of candidates and seeking referrals. Despite the different efforts we have tried, there seems to be a disconnect. If I am elected on the NAACL Board, I would love to work on closing this gap and establishing the NLP Marketplace to actively connect NLP experts with industry opportunities.
Supporting Undergraduate & High School Students: I am a big believer in nurturing the scientists of tomorrow. What a better way to accomplish this than by introducing the world of NLP to high school and undergraduate students at an early stage, offering them opportunities to engage in research and enabling them to showcase their findings at the NAACL conference. I am enthusiastic about establishing summer programs and crafting tutorials specifically tailored to students at this level. Also I would love to create a fund that provides free registration and travel support, thereby making it more accessible for young talents to participate and thrive in our NLP Community.

Currently, as part of his current position, he is also working on information retrieval and large language models.



#### Candidacy Statement

NAACL has been historically build around a USA and Canada centric view of community. However, this does not represent all countries, languages and communities form the region. Therefore, If I am elected as a chair on the board, I work towards:

Linguistic Diversity. Pushing forward the agenda of linguistical diversity, working towards including all languages from our continent (including minority and indigenous languages) in our venues. Supporting great existing initiatives as special theme tracks, and language diversity regular tracks. Additionally, we need to strength the inclusion of local indigenous researchers and universities into the NLP community via funding
Inclusion of the South. I will also work to continue with integrating researchers from all the regions and communities of the Americas (LATAM/Caribbean/indigenous) into the NAACL chapter. The main points (but not limited to) are: i) continue to have more NAACL conferences south of the USA border; ii) prioritize visa friendly countries to held conferences; iii) unification between the north and the south NLP communities; iv) change “North America“ from NAACL to “Pan-American” (or any term that includes all the continent); v) interact constantly with researchers from the south, so I can bring their needs and thoughts to the board.
Open research and reproducibility. In order to have a more equal research community spread around the world, we need also to double down on the basics of science: open research; reproducibility; double-blind reviewing; and bias reduction.
Build community and Unity. I will also support and learn from other communities present on the board and outside, to hear their needs and aims. If we learn to listen to each other, we can growth our research community unity. For this, we also need transparency at all levels inside our organization.

#### Candidacy Statement

As a board member, I would like to ensure that we work on the following issues:

Engagement. One issue that I see as pivotal is keeping our conferences exciting, accessible and welcoming to both junior and senior researchers. Recent years have seen some active NLP researchers drift away and disengage, preferring to present their work at general machine learning venues instead. While  it's great to see more NLP work presented to the larger ML community, I'd like to make sure that we have policies in place that encourage engagement and  participation. This includes making sure our publication and anonymity policies are acceptable to community members, that service and participation in conference organization committees is properly incentivised, that our policies are transparent, accessible, and aligned with the *CL community at large.

Reproducibility. As in many other fields, we currently face a reproducibility crisis. We need formal mechanisms to counteract it that go beyond contacting the authors and discussing issues on social media and in our personal networks. A number of methods have now been proposed to encourage reproducibility, but most have not been widely implemented. As a board member, I would like to ensure that we take action towards formalizing some of the proposed mechanisms. 
Ethics and social impact. Amid growing concerns about research ethics and social impact of our research, a number of initiatives have been undertaken recently to change how we think about potential impact of our research both on different social groups and society at large. Ethics are a delicate matter, and hasty decisions may easily lead to disastrous effects. I would work to ensure that such initiatives are systematic and well thought-out, and that we have a wide community support.

Her team TacoBot won third place in the first Alexa Prize TaskBot challenge and was the only award-winning team in the US. 


#### Candidacy Statement

It’s a great honor for me to be considered as a NAACL board member. I will be committed to serving the NLP community if elected. My vision revolves around three core principles, which I believe are crucial for the continued growth and excellence of our community.

1. Facilitating discussions on conference policies: The policies governing paper submission (e.g., anonymity, arXiv), reviewing, and awards are at the heart of our community's fairness and transparency. I aim to facilitate open and constructive dialogues to refine these policies. As a board member, I will work tirelessly to ensure that our conference policies are inclusive, equitable, and adaptive, especially given the fast pace of current research development. I will actively seek feedback from the community and advocate for policies that align with our collective values.
   
2. Promoting interdisciplinary work: Our field is undergoing a revolution driven by the advances in large language models (LLMs). On the one hand, it is crucial that we extend the reach of NLP beyond our traditional boundaries and harness its transformative potential to address real-world challenges in various domains such as healthcare, social justice, and environmental science. On the other hand, it is important for the NLP community to draw insights from other disciplines like psychology and neuroscience to develop innovative techniques. As a board member, I will support the creation of dedicated tracks, workshops, and incentives for interdisciplinary research. By fostering collaboration across domains, we can facilitate the growth of both NLP and other fields in a mutually beneficial manner .
   
3. Supporting students and low-resourced researchers: One of the most pressing issues in our community is the financial barrier that prevents many students and low-resourced researchers from participating in *CL conferences. Travel costs are often prohibitively high, and a limited budget from funding agencies leaves many deserving researchers unable to attend. If elected, I am committed to expanding travel support for students and low-resourced researchers (e.g., researchers who have papers to present but are transitioning between jobs or just start on a new position and have to support multiple students to attend), especially those from underrepresented groups. By seeking additional sponsorship and optimizing the allocation of resources,  I hope to ensure that a more diverse and representative group of young researchers benefit from the invaluable experiences *CL conferences offer.

#### Candidacy Statement

The very recent rapid advancement of NLP has opened up many challenges and opportunities for our community. If elected as a NAACL board member, I would like to be dedicated to the following initiatives:
Supporting Aspiring Academics. The rapid development of large language models and generative AI has left many young students in academia uncertain about their research direction. Aspiring academics need guidance more than ever. I aim to provide support for junior students by fostering a sense of community and establishing seamless communication via mentoring programs where they can receive advice from senior researchers.
Advancing NLP for Social Good through Interdisciplinary Collaboration. One of my visions is to translate NLP technology of research models to real-world applications that eventually create positive impacts for humans and society. I aspire to drive interdisciplinary efforts between NLP and other fields such as education, healthcare, and law. This will be achieved by organizing new workshops and inviting speakers from other fields to facilitate the design, development, and deployment of NLP for social good.
Modernizing and Strengthening the Reviewing System. Our community has recently seen heated discussions that highlighted the urgent need for an evolved reviewing system. I am dedicated to establishing a reviewing system that is both modern to accommodate fast research development and robust to align with the meticulous nature of scientific progress. I will work closely with other parties such as ARR editors and underrepresented research members to fully incorporate diverse opinions and voices of different stakeholders to inform our collective decision.
