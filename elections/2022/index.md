Chair nominee:
------------------

<a name="Benotti"> </a>

### [Luciana Benotti](https://benotti.github.io/)

#### Bio

Luciana Benotti is an Associate Professor at the Department of Computer Science in the Universidad Nacional de Córdoba, in Argentina. Her research interests cover many aspects of situated dialogue, including the study of misunderstandings, clarification requests and grounding. She has a PhD in Computer Science from INRIA, Nancy Grand Est, France. She received an IBM SUR award for her work on robust conversational interfaces, and a Google RISE award for her outreach efforts in developing AI-based technology for education. She has been an invited scholar at the University of Trento (2019), Stanford University (2018), Roskilde University (2014), University of Lorraine (2013), Universidad de Costa Rica (2012), and University of Southern California (2010). She regularly serves under different roles in the ACL community. She has been a volunteer during conferences, a reviewer since 2010, an area chair for dialogue and interactive systems several times, and a member of the executive board of SIGDIAL and SIGSEM. She is currently an elected officer at the NAACL executive board for 2021 and 2022. She is also serving as ARR action editor, ACL 2022 tutorial chair and NAACL 2022 D&I advisor.

#### Candidacy Statement

If I am elected as chair of the board, I will keep working actively towards maintaining the high quality of the *CL conferences, while focusing on supporting diversity and inclusion. As a Latinamerican researcher, I know first hand the serious problems that overlooking these issues provoke. I will coordinate NAACL exec board responsibilities in collaboration with the ACL. I will continue enabling the initiatives I proposed as an officer, which have made good progress in this short time thanks to the work of the current NAACL exec board and the ACL community.  

- Care about ethics: I will support the continued inclusion of an ethical impact statement for all papers submitted to *CL conferences. Such statements should not only consider privacy, gender and race, but also take economy, power and climate into account. I will work towards improving the ethical reviewing through consensus in the community, serving as one of the Members at Large of the newly-formed ACL Ethics Committee. 

- Encourage reproducibility: I will continue to explore incentives to encourage the release of implementation code, data, metadata, and trained models required to reproduce the results of all papers submitted to NAACL. These measures would not only improve transparency, but they would help researchers with low computing budgets implement their ideas and help reduce carbon footprint. I will support the publication of reproducibility studies, in particular when applied to languages other than English. 

- Lower barriers: I will continue to strengthen diversity and inclusion initiatives at NAACL from different perspectives. In particular, I will work towards increasing the amount of fee waivers and strive to get travel grants for those who face financial barriers. Moreover, during the pandemic the organization of virtual conferences has successfully increased participation of underrepresented communities, and I will investigate and measure the impact of hybrid alternatives in the future. 

- Build community: I will support initiatives that broaden and strengthen NAACL´s community.  Many successful community building activities are already rolling (e.g., Birds of a feather, ACL mentoring, WiNLP, RAF, Masakane, Queer and LatinX in AI, among others). The next step is to improve communication lines and coordinate joint efforts so that they benefit from each other.

### [Heng Ji](http://blender.cs.illinois.edu/hengji.html)

#### Bio
Heng Ji is a professor at Computer Science Department, and an affiliated faculty member at Electrical and Computer Engineering Department of University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. She is an Amazon Scholar. She received her B.A. and M. A. in Computational Linguistics from Tsinghua University, and her M.S. and Ph.D. in Computer Science from New York University. Her research interests focus on Natural Language Processing, especially on Multimedia Multilingual Information Extraction, Knowledge Base Population and Knowledge-driven Generation. She was selected as "Young Scientist" and a member of the Global Future Council on the Future of Computing by the World Economic Forum in 2016 and 2017. The awards she received include "AI's 10 to Watch" Award by IEEE Intelligent Systems in 2013, NSF CAREER award in 2009, Google Research Award in 2009 and 2014, IBM Watson Faculty Award in 2012 and 2014, Bosch Research Award in 2014-2018, Best-of-ICDM2013 Paper, Best-of-SDM2013 Paper, ACL2020 Best Demo Paper Award, and NAACL2021 Best Demo Paper Award. She is elected as the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (NAACL) secretary 2020-2021. She has served as the Program Committee Co-Chair of many conferences including NAACL-HLT2018, and she has been the coordinator for the NIST TAC Knowledge Base Population track since 2010.

#### Candidacy Statement
In the past one and a half years, I have run the NAACL election in a well-organized, fair and transparent format, with the great help from the nomination committee and the ACL Information Technology Director Dr. Nitin Madnani. I have handled external communications through the NAACL website, mailing lists and social media in a clear and timely manner, and took meeting notes. I have constructed a repository of guidelines and materials for PC chairs, and built "ReviewRobot", an automatic paper scoring and review generation system [Wang et al., INLG2020] which can potentially serve as a review assistant. I have also started building a Who's Who knowledge base for NLP researchers using the information extraction and knowledge base population techniques that my research group has developed. I would appreciate the opportunity to serve for another term as NAACL secretary so I could have sufficient time to wrap up and release the PC chair material repository, and work with NAACL and ACL executive committees to figure out the best way to integrate and utilize the ReviewRobot and the NLP Who's Who KB in NAACL/ACL platforms.


Board Member nominees:
----------------------
<a name="Blanco"> </a>

### [Eduardo Blanco](http://www.cse.unt.edu/~blanco/)

#### Bio
Eduardo Blanco is an Associate Professor at Arizona State
University. He was previously an Assistant Professor (2014-2020) and
Associate Professor (2020-2021) at University of North Texas. He
received his PhD in 2011 from The University of Texas at Dallas. He
has been a reviewer for *ACL conferences for over a decade and
currently serves in the standing reviewer team of the Computational
Linguistics and Transactions of the Association for Computational
Linguistics journals. He has co-organized multiple workshops
collocated with *ACL conferences and served as Area Chair and Demo
Chair for several ACL, NAACL and EMNLP conferences. He also served as
Virtual Infrastructure Co-Chair for EMNLP 2020, where he was
responsible for designing and coordinating the caption editing process
to improve accessibility of prerecorded presentations.

#### Candidacy Statement
The community has proposed and implemented several initiatives to
improve the reviewing process, ensure high quality programs in
conferences, and broaden participation (Student Research Workshops,
Emerging Regions funds, WiNLP, etc.). If elected to the NAACL board, I
will work on initiatives to broaden participation and improve access:

- Geography. The NAACL constitution states that NAACL will serve ACL
  members in Central America and South America until regional chapters
  are created. I will support ongoing initiatives (LatinX in AI,
  Emerging Regions Fund, etc.) and work towards having more in-person
  conferences in these regions (assuming the pandemic allows us to).

- Cost. Attending our conferences is outside the budget of many
  researchers. Based on what I learned serving as Virtual
  Infrastructure Co-Chair for EMNLP 2020, I will work towards
  standardizing processes to offer hybrid conferences. I believe that
  hybrid conferences will allow many more researchers to participate
  and that most researchers who currently attend in person will
  continue to do so.

- Non-native English speakers and ableism. Many researchers in our
  region are non-native English speakers or hard of hearing. Offering
  captions will not only enhance the experience of non-native
  speakers, but also partially address ableism. Prerecorded
  presentations can be automatically captioned and then edited by the
  presenter, similar to what we did at EMNLP 2020.  I will also
  explore options to offer captions for live presentations.

has been supported by the NSF, NIH, Army Research Office, National
Endowment for the Humanities, among others. She has served as a
Program Co-Chair for NAACL 2021, area chair for ACL 2020, NAACL-HLT
2019, and COLING 2018, and co-organized a number of workshops,
including Insights from Negative Results in NLP (Insights @ EMNLP
2020, EMNLP 2021), Evaluating Vector Space Representations for NLP
(RepEval @ NAACL 2019), and the Clinical Natural Language Processing
Workshop (COLING 2016, NAACL 2019, EMNLP 2020).

#### Candidacy Statement
As a board member, I would like to ensure that we work on the
following issues:

- Reproducibility. As in many other fields, we currently face a
    reproducibility crisis. We need formal mechanisms to
    counteract it that go beyond contacting the authors and discussing
    issues on social media and in our personal networks. A
    number of methods have now been proposed to encourage
    reproducibility, but most have not been widely implemented. As a
    board member, I would like to ensure that we take action towards
    formalizing some of the proposed mechanisms.

- Accessibility. One clear benefit of switching conferences to
    virtual format this year was improved access to top
    conferences so many of us who would not be able attend in
    person. It is clear that we need to figure out how to run
    conferences in a hybrid mode without creating a two-tier
    system. Should we have remote and live components to every
    conference, with papers presented at both or randomly assigned to
    one of the modalities? Which events can be run in both
    modalities? As a board member, I would like to explore and
    understand what our solutions should be.

- Ethics and social impact. Amid growing concerns about research
    ethics and social impact of our research, a number of
    initiatives have been undertaken recently to change how we think
    about potential impact of our research both on different
    social groups and society at large. Ethics are a delicate matter,
    and hasty decisions may easily lead to disastrous
    effects. I would work to ensure that such initiatives are
    systematic and well thought-out, and that we have a wide
    community support.

<a name="Solorio"> </a>

### [Thamar Solorio](http://solorio.uh.edu/)

#### Bio
Thamar Solorio is professor in the Department of Computer Science at
the University of Houston (UH). Her main research interests include
information extraction for user generated data, NLP for linguistically
diverse speakers, and more recently, multimodal processing of text and
video.  She has M.S. and PhD degrees in Computer Science from INAOE,
Puebla, Mexico. Her research program has been supported by the
Department of Defense, the National Science Foundation, the Office of
Naval Research, and ADOBE Inc. She is the recipient of an NSF CAREER
award for her work on authorship analysis. She is also a recipient of
the 2014 Emerging Leader ABIE Award in honor of Denice Denton. She
serves as editorial board member for the Computer Speech and Language
Journal. She has served as reviewer and area chair to ACL, NAACL,
AAAI, among others, and was program co-chair for NAACL 2019.

#### Candidacy Statement
I was elected to the board during a difficult 2020, and sadly I wasn't
able to really achieve much in terms of my stated goals for
NAACL. Meanwhile, ACL and NAACL have made important progress towards a
more inclusive community, and if reelected I would work to support and
extend these efforts.

I would like to help implement a tiered conference registration where
medium and large tech companies pay higher registration prices than
participants from non-profit institutions. The goal is to spend the
additional funds collected through registration to increase access to
the conference in the form of more travel grants, infrastructure
support for virtual components, individual flexible grants for
individuals with unique challenges to attend the conference (paying
extra hours for childcare at home, airfare for child care provider,
etc.), and augment funds allocated for the NAACL Regional Americas
Fund, as well as to explore the creation of additional supporting
initiatives. One idea is to create a NAACL distinguished speaker
series, where well established researchers commit to travel to a
region typically underrepresented in our community to give a tutorial
and interact with the research community in that place.

Additionally, this year I would also like to explore approaches that
foster a more synergistic collaboration and involvement of industry
and academia/non-profit organizations. The scale of resources needed
nowadays to explore deep learning approaches that continue to deliver
successful results is aggravating disparity for researchers with
limited access to these resources. One solution is to mentor our
reviewers to value contributions that are not the expected large
models, and our community is already making great progress in this
respect, for example with submission tracks dedicated to NLP for
under-resourced languages. We should do more, not to slow down the
progress of large models, but to protect the intellectual value and
creativity of research ideas that are critically needed to secure the
sustained growth of NLP communities world-wide, and the advancement of
NLP technology in all regions of the world. A good initial step
towards this goal would be to establish targeted discussions with
researchers from underrepresented communities and form an accurate
understanding of their research environments, needs, and the best ways
in which industry and big labs can collaborate to support these
communities.

#### Candidacy Statement
Many thanks for considering me for an additional term as NAACL board
member. The first term has provided an extremely interesting
opportunity to get involved in NAACL activities and its presence
within our various communities, in particular as a member of
the Regional Americas Fund (RAF) committee. For the second term, my
plan is to continue to work towards promoting and supporting
initiatives, like WiNLP, for increasing diversity and inclusion of
underrepresented NLP communities, supporting the growth of programs,
like the Regional Americas Fund (RAF) and the amazing actions that it
supports throughout the Americas, with its rich ecosystem of languages
(and cultures) and the brave communities that have worked for their
documentation and processing, often in (very) low-resourced
settings. This also includes helping to promote opportunities for
supporting language diversity in our events, to increase visibility
and dissemination of regional efforts and help to strengthen links and
fostering collaborations among the communities. In addition, I will
continue to support greater presence of interdisciplinary initiatives
in NAACL events for facilitating interactions that include a diversity
of areas.

#### Candidacy Statement
Recently, there has been exciting and rapid growth in our NAACL
community, which has attracted a growing number of participants from
various research communities, cultures, and countries. If elected as a
board member, I would like to work towards a more diverse and
inclusive NAACL through the following initiatives:

- Promoting interdisciplinary work: One of my goals is to help
promote more interdisciplinary research within the NAACL community,
by coordinating joint tutorials or workshops with communities such as
Computer Vision, Robotics, HCI and Social Science, and improving the
review criteria/process for these interdisciplinary works.

- Establishing programs to highlight early career researchers: I
would like to work towards establishing Highlights Programs for new
faculty or researchers in industry, to provide them with
opportunities to connect with peers, get advice (e.g., teaching,
student supervision) from senior colleagues, gain visibility, and
engage with our NLP community by active participation in various ways
and capacities.

- Supporting undergraduate students and high school students: I
would like to help figure out ways on how we can attract and support
undergraduates and high school students into NLP, e.g., via
establishing summer school programs or certain funded programs that
offer free registration and travel awards.

- Increasing language support for non-native English speakers: I
hope to work towards more language inclusive communities, via efforts
to support both non-native English presenters and attendees (e.g.,
during Q&A, writing support, and etc.).
