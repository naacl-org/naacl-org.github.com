### About the naacl.org website

The naacl.org website is maintained by the current NAACL Secretary.

This website was designed and developed by [Anoop Sarkar](http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~anoop) (Secretary of the NAACL board from 2009-2011 and 2011-2013) in 2012.

Thanks to the students from the [SFU Natural Language Lab](http://natlang.cs.sfu.ca) for helping to port information from the older hand-written HTML site to the new on, especially thanks to Marzieh Razavi, Max Whitney, Majid Razmara, Ann Clifton and Ravikiran Vadlapudi.

The website was built using [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and is hosted on [github](http://github.com). The website source can be viewed on the [naacl-org github repository](https://github.com/naacl-org/naacl-org.github.com).

The readme.md file on the github repository explains how to maintain the website and add new information, such as new posts, minutes, officers, etc.
