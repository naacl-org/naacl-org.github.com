The purpose of the chapter is to constitute the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics as it was chartered (on August eight, one thousand nine hundred ninety-eight) by the Executive Committee of the Association for Computational Linguistics, an association and legal entity according to the laws of Virginia, United States of America.

    1.  To encourage and facilitate membership in the Association by persons and institutions in North America.
    2.  To provide a regional focus for members of the Association in North America and a source of information on North American activities for the Association Executive Committee.
    3.  If necessary, to establish banking facilities in North America that simplify financial transactions with the Association by its North American members.
    4.  To establish distribution facilities for the dissemination of Association and Chapter publications and information materials.
    5.  To promote cooperation and information exchange among related scientific and professional societies within North America.

Constituency
------------

**Article 4**.

1.  Within the rules of the constitution of the Association, the Chapter will serve all members of the Association who reside in North America. In addition, until regional chapters are created for the Association members in the adjacent regions of Central America and South America, the Chapter will serve them as well. These persons will hereinafter be referred to as "the Chapter Members".
2.  Members of the Association who presently reside elsewhere but who believe that their interests are best represented by the North American chapter may petition for membership in the North American chapter instead of the chapter most pertinent to their current geographical residence. Such petitions will be reviewed by the Chapter Board; upon a majority vote of the Board in favor of approving the petition, the petitioner will be granted membership for five years.
