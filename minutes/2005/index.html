<b>[1] Treasurer's report</b> 
<p>
Dragomir Radev reviewed the <a href="http://www.naacl.org/minutes/2005-06-minutes.htm#treasrep-start">Treasurer's report, included below</a>.  
Some points not already covered in that report are as follows.  
<p>
The approximately $4000 that the NAACL received for ACL 02 represents
half of the profits, the other half going to the ACL.
<p>
The NAACL keeps all profits from HLT-NAACL 2003.  SIGNLL's loss of $200
resides with the ACL.
<p>
HLT-NAACL 2004 accounting will be done in the next few months or so.
It is anticipated that neither a profit nor a loss will be turned:
Julia Hirschberg's budget appears to have been on target and attendance
was good.
<p>
This year, approximately $8000 is expected to be allocated to support
for the Johns Hopkins Summer School on Human Language Technology.
<p>
The fees and interest amounts that
haven't been resolved are negligible (sometimes $30/month, sometimes
$12/month, sometimes $0/month).
<p>
The NAACL shares in the profit or loss of ACL 2005, for which the
current estimate is 680 participants (the budget anticipated 500).
<p>
It was noted that the NAACL has both a &quot;true&quot; individual account
and a shadow account with the ACL.  The shadow account should be used
for conference dealings, as this facilitates certain transactions
(such as borrowing from the ACL for deposits; incidentally, such borrowing
also occurred to cover the expenses for the JHU summer school in 2004
due to an unexpected fluctuation in the NAACL's account), with
balancing of the NAACL account happening later (e.g., with the ACL
giving the NAACL a lump sum).  However, the deposit for the Brooklyn
meeting in 2006 came out of the NAACL individual account.

<a name="min-sec"></a>
<b>[2] Secretary's report</b>
<p>
The results of the 2004 voting (election of new members and changes to
the constitution regarding term limits plus some wording updates) were
reviewed.  
<p>
One pending issue is the interpretation of the phrases &quot;board
member&quot; vs. &quot;Board Member&quot;, where the general consensus
is that the the latter term does not include the Chair, Secretary,
Treasurer, Past Chair, or ACL Treasurer, whereas the former term
does.  It was suggested that the  capitalized phrase be replaced
with &quot;Member-at-large&quot;.
Rather than have an independent round of voting to insert this
clarification into the the constitution, it seems preferable for now
to simply allow the minutes for today's meeting to serve as a record of
this ***POLICY*** decision, reserving the actual voting on the requisite change(s) to the
constitution for a time when other proposals for amendments should
arise.  This kind of procedure is also used by IJCAI, which has formal
bylaws but has &quot;in
practice&quot; instructions appear in the minutes.

<b>[3] Arrangements for meetings (general discussion)</b>
<p>

--- <em>the role of the ACL Secretariat/Business Manager</em> ---

<p>

It was suggested that the role of the ACL business manager in helping
with local arrangements be clarified.  It does not seem that said role
is explicitly specified in the ACL conference handbook. [A quick
post-hoc scan of the local-arrangements-chair section of the handbook
reveals the following passages: &quot;Negotiating with provider(s) of
accommodations: hotel and/or dormitory organizers. Centrally, this
involves negotiating a contract for the services provided, with
financial guarantees. The ACL Secretariat (Priscilla Rasmussen) has
considerable experience in this area.&quot; and, in the section on
accommodations, &quot;Negotiating with provider(s) of accommodations:
hotel and/or dormitory organizers. Centrally, this involves
negotiating a contract for the services provided, with financial
guarantees. <em>The ACL Secretariat (Priscilla Rasmussen) has
considerable experience in this area.</em>&quot; (emphasis in the
original)].  Most importantly, the possibility arises for confusion
with regards to the degree of communication and consultation that
should occur between the Local Arrangements Chair (and Co-Chair, if
one has been designated) and the ACL Secretariat (in general, more
consultation is probably better than less) during the initial planning
phases (e.g., choosing accommodation and entertainment options).  

<p>

It might also be helpful to have the role of the business manager
explicitly addressed in the call for bids for hosting meetings so that
potential local arrangements chairs have the right expectations.

<p> 

Given that the role the business manager plays or is expected to play
has not been explicitly specified, the issue of reimbursement has also
not been explicitly addressed.  If the business manager plays a more
active official role, should he or she be reimbursed per registrant or
per hour?  Should there be a cap on the amount of reimbursement?  How
should oversight be handled? (Points of comparison: at ACL 2005
(University of Michigan, Ann Arbor), UM's conference services were
used, and the lead contact there received $30/registrant.  For
HLT-NAACL-04, the business manager plus her elves received
approximately $11,000, with $7500 budgeted for local staff.  The HLT-NAACL
2006 budget lists $12,000, with $15,000 allotted for local staff salary.)
<p>

--- <em>oversight committees for non-joint meetings</em> ---

<p>

Previous calls for bids for hosting meetings make reference to a
conference oversight committee.  The oversight committee concept arose
from previous joint meetings.  In cases where the annual meeting is
not joint, it was suggested that the oversight committee consist of
the NAACL Executive Board and the conference chairs.
<p>

<a name="min-schools"></a>
<b>[4] Summer schools</b>
<p>

--- <em>the LSA 2005 summer institute</em> ---<p>

For the Linguistic Society of America (LSA) 2005 summer institute, the
NAACL contributed $2000 (while the NAACL considered this to constitute
a &quot;sponsorship&quot;, the LSA considered this to be a
&quot;co-sponsorship&quot;, distinguishing it from
&quot;sponsorship&quot;), as the Institute held a number of courses
directly related to computational linguistics.  The NAACL Exec also
formed a committee, consisting of Lillian Lee, Evelyne Tzoukermann,
and Janyce Wiebe, to run a competition for 10%-of-tuition awards for
NAACL student members attending the institute.  Two inquiries and one
application resulted, and $200 was duly awarded to the applicant (via
direct payment, rather than through arrangements with the LSA).  Thus,
the overall level of interest did not seem to justify the level of
organizational effort expended, so perhaps a different avenue for
supporting NAACL students and/or the LSA summer institute should be
explored.

<p>

--- <em>the JHU 2005 summer school</em> ---<p>

While the official agreement for support of the Johns Hopkins Summer
Schools in Human Language Technology has ended, the NAACL responded
positively to JHU's request for support this year.  (Whether the NAACL
will continue to support the school depends in part on the formal
student feedback the NAACL will be requesting this year.) The NAACL's
competition, run by Ellen Riloff, Andy Kehler, and Evelyne
Tzoukermann, for scholarships to the summer school received 12
applications.  All eleven North American applications were accepted:
the nine PhD students received full support, and the masters students
received the equivalent of the registration fee ($350).  One issue is
that the JHU program is explicitly meant to encourage undergrad
involvement, although it should be noted that a good number of the
applicants came from (slightly) disadvantaged schools.  The quality of
the applicant pool was high, but it was noted that the size of the
pool has been dropping (16 in the previous year, which was about half
of the year before that).  

<p>
The summer school itself overlaps with this
year's ACL, and there seemed to have been some confusion over whether
summer-school attendees were allowed to go to the ACL meeting.  Also,
the NAACL's application deadline was too close to JHU's housing office's
deadline for determining how many rooms were going to be needed.

<p>
It was suggested that archives are needed for application
forms and the like.

<b>[5] Location for the 2007 meeting</b><p>

Evelyne Tzoukermann is organizing the competition for hosting bids; a
draft of the call has been sent out to the committee.  Preference for
a west-coast location was discussed.

<b>[6] HLT-NAACL 2006</b><p>

Satoshi Sekine and Bob Moore participated in a discussion of progress
on planning for the 2006 meeting.  A two-minute promotional video was
also viewed.
<p>


---  <em>events and facilities</em> --- <p>

Arrangements are being made for a July 11th meeting with the staff of
the Marriott New York at the Brooklyn Bridge (tentative NAACL
attendees: Ralph Grishman, Bob Moore, Priscilla Rasmussen, Satoshi
Sekine). The plan is to have everything (tutorials, workshops,
reception, etc.)  but the banquet at the hotel.

<p>
The banquet was planned for an NYU facility with a capacity of 320.
Discussion ensued about whether this was too small.  Points of
information:  for ACL 2005, anticipated attendance was 420 for the
reception and 375 for the banquet.  In the previous year, banquet
attendance was capped.  Priscilla Rasmussen suggested planning for 550
or so for the 2006 meeting.  In terms of fees, the $75 banquet fee for
ACL 2005 was considered to be high.

<p>
Dorm reservations cannot be accepted until the fall, but the dorm
facilities have not been committed to other parties.

<p> Some re-tooling of the student research workshop is under
consideration.  One question is why the NAACL version has had low
submission rates in previous years (with some scheduling glitches not
necessarily explaining the problem), whereas the ACL versions have
attracted high interest (including from students in North
America).  
<p>

--- <em>staff and related budget items</em> --- <p>

On the NYU staff, aside from the Local Arrangements Chair and
Co-Chair, there is Koji Murakami (a postdoc who was involved
in ACL 2003) and Anne Seaton (NYU department
staff &quot;donated&quot; by the Dean's office; Satoshi Sekine is checking to confirm the commitment).  It
should be noted that neither are professional event coordinators; such
folks are expensive in the NYC area.  
<p>
Some suggestions for handling the involvement of  the ACL Business
Manager, Priscilla Rasmussen, were to have her serve as additional
paid staff (and thus wear two hats).  To divide up the $15000 in
the budget, perhaps $8K could go toward the NYU administrative costs
for 3-4 months of effort, an extra $1K-$2K could be allotted towards
runners in the last month, and $3-$4K could go towards the ACL
Business Manager's additional time.

<p>
There was some question of
whether it would be OK to use volunteers and the NAACL's own
equipment, or whether union labor needs to be used.  

<p>

--- <em>budget status</em> --- <p>

The target for a final draft budget is the end of August. <p>

NYU has set up an account, which allows for tax exempt status.  

<p>

--- <em>refereeing and publication software</em> --- <p>

The ACL executive would like reviewing timelines to be reduced from 7
weeks to six, with START software facilitating this change. ACL is
renegotiating with the START administrators, and is hoping that
features such as camera-ready submission will be handled.  It is hoped
that the publications chairs will be able to use some of the previous
publications software that had been developed by people at Johns Hopkins.

<a NAME="treasrep-start"></a><h4>NAACL Treasurer's report</h4>
Dragomir R. Radev, June 23, 2005

As of last year's ACL conference, the balance in the NAACL shadow
account was $11,820.51. Since then, we have finalized the accounting
for ACL 2002 and HLT-NAACL 2003 which both brought in surpluses into
the account.

<p>

This year, the NAACL exec decided to sponsor two events - the LSA
summer institute and the JHU summer school. We will be spending a
total of $12k on these two events.

<p>
Balance sheet as of June 20, 2005
<pre>
   balance as of 04         11,820.51
   + ACL 02 surplus       +  4,083.82
   - JHU SS 2004          -  9,801.73
   - LSA 2005             -  2,200.00
   + HLT-NAACL 03 surplus + 49,087.61
                            ---------
                            52,930.21
</pre>
A small number of charges still need to be resolved, mostly associated
with the fees that the bank charges and the interest that it pays
back. These should be resolved soon.
