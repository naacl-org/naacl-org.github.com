Call For NAACL Scholarship Applications To The Two-Week Undergraduate Summer School At The 2022 Annual Jelinek Memorial Workshop On Speech And Language Technology (JSALT)
----------------------------------

The North American Chapter of the Association for Computational
Linguistics (NAACL) is again offering an exciting summer school
opportunity for a limited number of undergraduate students interested
in the field of Human Language Technology.

__What is this scholarship for?__ A continuation of the Johns Hopkins
University CLSP summer workshop series from 1995-2020, JSALT brings
notable researchers and students together to collaborate on selected
research topics for six weeks, following a special two-week
undergraduate education session.  Those first two weeks provide
students with general introductions to the major areas of study within
the field of Human Language Technology (e.g., Natural Language
Processing, Automatic Speech Recognition, Machine Translation,
Information Retrieval), as well as sessions on specialized research
topics of current interest in the field.

__What does the scholarship cover?__ The NAACL scholarship is used to
support undergraduate students from the Americas to participate in the
two-week summer school. Specifically, it covers the mandatory
registration and housing costs for the full duration. In addition, up
to $650 USD will be given to the student to offset travel
costs. Additional travel support may be available for students with
exceptionally high travel costs. Meals and other incidental expenses
are not covered.

__Who can apply for this scholarship?__ Students must be enrolled or
pre-enrolled at an institution in the Americas to qualify. Preference
will be given to high-quality undergraduate students at a stage in
their careers during which attendance at the summer school will
provide maximum benefit; in particular, undergraduates who have
completed at least their junior year of study. Graduate and
Postdoctoral applications will not be accepted. Students who are
selected for the summer school are expected to attend all two weeks of
the summer school.

__How do I apply for this scholarship?__ Easy! Fill in the form at
<https://forms.gle/XdhghF4QhtN45EWL9> and arrange for one to two short
letters of reference to be sent to <naacl-jhu-workshop@googlegroups.com>
by __Wednesday, May 11, 2022__.
