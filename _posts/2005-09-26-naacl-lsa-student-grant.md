**The competition is now closed. Thanks to all who applied for their interest!**

As an educational initiative, the North American Association for Computational Linguistics (NAACL) is providing a limited number of grants to help students attend the Linguistic Society of America (LSA) 2005 Institute, held this summer at MIT.

### The 2005 Institute

Courses are offered in many areas of theoretical, experimental, and historical linguistics, including acquisition, computational linguistics, dialectology, language change, morphology, neurolinguistics, phonetics, phonology, pragmatics, psycholinguistics, semantics, and syntax. There will also be classes with a specific language or language-family orientation, including African American English, Algonquian, American Sign Language, Anatolian, Austronesian, Chinese, Gbe, Indo-European, Irish, Japanese, and Salish.

### NAACL awards

Award decisions will be based on the merits of the case. For example, it is understood that graduate and undergraduate students have different expected profiles. Up to eight awards will be made.

The amount of the grants will correspond to 10% of tuition (therefore, award winners who register for the six-week session will receive a different amount than those who register for a single three-week session). This amount will be sent directly to the winners, not to the Institute; winners will need to pay full tuition and fees to the Institute.

### Eligibility

The competition is open to those who, at the time of application, both hold student membership in the NAACL and have registered for the Institute. (A student member of the NAACL is a student member of the ACL who either resides in North or South America or has had a membership petition approved by the Chapter Board.)

### Important dates

-   April 1: Applications for NAACL grants due
-   May 2: Notification deadline
-   June 27-July 16: LSA session 1 (and first half of the six-week session)
-   June 17-August 5: LSA session 2 (and second half of the six-week session)
-   Note that grants may not disbursed before May 31, the deadline for final payment to the Institute.

### Application instructions

Applications are to be sent as a single, sensibly-formatted plain ASCII email (no attachments) to lsa2005-awards@aclweb.org. The following information must be included, in the order specified:

-   Full name, current academic institution, email address(es) and telephone number(s) in April and May (applicable dates specified), and Institute session(s) registered for
-   Statement describing how attending the Institute will further your educational and/or career plans. A summary of your relevant background and a specification of the Institute courses you plan to take or audit should be integrated into this statement. The statement may be as brief or as long as you feel is appropriate.
-   Any publications and any awards received
-   Names, dates of attendance, and any degrees received for undergraduate and any graduate institutions attended. For each institution, provide a chronological list, separated by term, of classes taken (descriptive name and course number) and grade received. (That is, we are asking for an easily-readable unofficial transcript.)
-   Other sources of financial support towards Institute attendance: for each, describe the amount and whether it is confirmed or pending (in the latter case, please provide the expected notification date). Note: having full financial support already available is not in itself disqualifying.
-   Name, email address(es), and phone number(s) of a reference who can comment on your academic and/or research qualifications. Please notify your reference that he or she may be contacted.
-   Failure to follow instructions may result in disqualification.
-   Awardees who do not attend the Institute must promptly return any grant money received.
