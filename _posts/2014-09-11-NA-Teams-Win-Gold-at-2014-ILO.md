Teams from USA and Canada recently won 10 medals including the team gold at the 2014 International Linguistics Olympiad in Beijing ([press release](http://www.nacloweb.org/resources/press_releases/naclo14pressrelease.pdf)). The teams were selected through the [North American Computational Linguistics Olympiad](http://www.nacloweb.org/) competition, sponsored in part by NAACL. There will also be a Francophone competition for the first time in 2015 (hosted in Canada).
