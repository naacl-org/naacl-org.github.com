The NAACL Board conducted a survey following the NAACL 2013 conference in Atlanta to get feedback from conference goers on how they liked the conference and what we can do to improve conferences in the future. You can read <a href="2013/post-conference-survey.pdf">the results of the survey</a>.

Congratulations to those who were elected, and thanks to all those who ran in the election and everyone who voted in the election.
