As announced in the NAACL Business Meeting, and through emails to the membership, the NAACL board was considering a changing the official name of the organization:

**From**: The North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics

**To**: The Nations of the Americas Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics

We concluded the vote on September 15th 2024, with the following result:

*  \# total eligible voters: 1444
*  Turnout: 526 (36%). As reference, NAACL 22-23 and 23-24 board election turnout was 17% and 18%, so there was strong turnout compared to historical elections.
*  Support name change: 77% (405)
*  Does not support name change: 23% (121)

Based on this result, the NAACL Board will be amending the NAACL constitution, effective immediately, to reflect the new name.

Thank you to all who participated in the discussion and voting!

The 2024 NAACL Board
